Spec: Page
The Page call lets you record whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page. Calling Page or
in a Segment
is one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.
Note: In
analytics.js
a Page call is included in the snippet by default
just after
analytics.load
. Many destinations require this page event to be fired at least once per page load for proper initialization. You may add an optional
name
or
properties
to the default call, or call it multiple times per page load if you have a single-page application.
Here’s the payload of a typical Page call with most
removed:
{
"type"
:
"page"
,
"name"
:
"Home"
,
"properties"
:
{
"title"
:
"Welcome | Initech"
,
"url"
:
"http://www.example.com"
}
}
And here’s the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload. If you’re using Segment’s JavaScript library, the page name and URL are automatically gathered and passed as properties into the event payload:
analytics
.
page
(
"
Retail Page
"
,
"
Home
"
);
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on the
page.
Beyond the common fields, the Page call takes the following fields:
Field
Type
Description
category
optional
String
The category of the page, added to the properties object.
Passed as the first argument in a page call, for example
analytics.page("category", "name");
name
optional
String
Name of the page
For example, most sites have a “Signup” page that can be useful to tag, so you can see users as they move through your funnel.
properties
optional
Object
Free-form dictionary of properties of the page, like
url
and
referrer
See the
for a list of reserved property names.

Create your own Page call
Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Page calls would look like with user-provided information:
Make a Page Call
Sample Page Call
Identities
The User ID is a unique identifier for the user performing the actions. Check out the
for more detail.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out the
for more detail.
Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically added
from the state stored by a previous
call, so you do not need to add it yourself. They will also automatically handle Anonymous IDs under the covers.
Properties
Properties are extra pieces of information that describe the page. They can be anything you want.
Segment handles properties with semantic meanings in unique ways. For example, Segment always expects
path
to be a page’s URL path, and
referrer
to be the previous page’s URL.
You should
only use reserved properties for their intended meaning
.
Reserved properties Segment has standardized:
Property
Type
Description
name
String
Name of the page. Reserved for future use.
path
String
Path portion of the page’s URL.  Equivalent to
which defaults to
from the DOM API.
referrer
String
Previous page’s full URL.  Equivalent to
from the DOM API.
search
String
Query string portion of the page’s URL. Equivalent to
from the DOM API.
title
String
Page’s title. Equivalent to
from the DOM API.
url
String
Page’s full URL. Segment first looks for the canonical URL. If the canonical URL is not provided, Segment uses
from the DOM API.
keywords
Array [String]
A list/array of keywords describing the page’s content. The keywords would most likely be the same as, or similar to, the keywords you would find in an HTML
tag for SEO purposes. This property is mainly used by content publishers that rely heavily on pageview tracking. This isn’t automatically collected.
Note:
In

title

path

url
,
referrer
