Spec: Screen
The Screen call lets you record whenever a user sees a screen, the mobile equivalent of Page, in your mobile app, along with any properties about the screen. Calling Page or
in one of Segment’s
is one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.
Here’s the payload of a typical Screen call, with most
removed:
{
"type"
:
"screen"
,
"name"
:
"Home"
,
"properties"
:
{
"Feed Type"
:
"private"
}
}
And here’s the corresponding Objective-C event that would generate the above payload:
[[
SEGAnalytics
sharedAnalytics
]
screen
:
@"Home"
properties:
@{
@"Feed Type"
:
@"private"
}];
Based on the library you use, the syntax in the examples might be different. You can find library-specific documentation on the
page.
Beyond the common fields, the Screen call takes the following fields:
_
Field
Type
Description
name
optional
String
Name of the screen
See the
for more details.
properties
optional
Object
Free-form dictionary of properties of the screen, like
name
See the
for a list of reserved property names.

Identities
The User ID is a unique identifier for the user performing the actions. Check out the
for more detail.
The Anonymous ID can be any pseudo-unique identifier, for cases where you don’t know who the user is, but you still want to tie them to an event. Check out the
for more detail.
Note: In our browser and mobile libraries a User ID is automatically added
from the state stored by a previous
call, so you do not need to add it yourself. They will also automatically handle Anonymous IDs under the covers.
Name
Each screen can be tagged with a
name
. For example, many apps have a “Signup” screen that can be useful to tag so that you can see users as they move through your funnel.
Properties
Properties are extra pieces of information that describe the screen. They can be anything you want.
Segment has reserved some properties with semantic meanings and handles them in special ways. You should
only use reserved properties for their intended meaning
.
Reserved properties that Segment has standardized:
Property
Type
Description
name
String
Name of the screen. This is reserved for future use.
