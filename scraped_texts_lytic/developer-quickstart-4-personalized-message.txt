3. Surface Personalized Message
The Lytics Personalization Engine profiles real-time access to a comprehensive visitor profile. Before we jump into the weeds of how you can fully build and leverage this profile, let's create our first experience.
Surface a Simple Message
Lytics comes with our Personalization SDK called Pathfora. Pathfora allows you to easily surface simple lead capture and messaging modals or content directly inline. Full
for Pathfora is available, but initially, let's surface a welcome message to our
anonymous visitor
audience.
javascript
// jstag profiles a helper function to ensure that the Pathfora library
// has been loaded before triggering the experience.
jstag

on
(
'pathfora.publish.done'
,
function
(
topic
,
event
){
// here we initialize a new Pathfora "Message" experience
var
module
=
new
pathfora
.
Message
({
id
:
'sample-message-campaign'
,
// this value will be collected along side all interactions and used in reporting
layout
:
'slideout'
,
// for layout we'll use a small slide out
position
:
'bottom-left'
,
// the model will enter and sit at the bottom left
theme
:
'dark'
,
// css can be customized to brand but we'll use the default dark theme
headline
:
'Hello world!'
,
// this will be the headline of our message
msg
:
'Congratulations on setting up your first targetted campaign using the Lytics Personalization Engine!'
,
// the body of the message
});
var
modules
=
{
target
: [{
segment
:
"anonymous_profiles"
,
// target only visitors with the anonymous_profile attribute
widgets
: [
module
]
}]
};
pathfora
.
initializeWidgets

);
// initialize the campaign
});
