2. Content Setup
Lytics' Interest Engines effectively analyze your content with minimal effort required. However, to guarantee that the classification results align with your expectations, conducting a quick test is advisable, as poor metadata can sometimes lead to less-than-optimal outcomes. The most reliable method to ensure comprehensive and satisfactory content classification is to classify a selection of your URLs manually.
Use the left-hand navigation to select
Content
>
Classification
.
Click on the section labeled
Classify
, then paste a URL from your website and press
Classify
.
After a moment or two, a set of preliminary classification details will come back. Most notably, ensure the
Title
,
Primary Image
, and
Topics
come back with content. If they do not, please refer to our
for configuring content and meta tags.
