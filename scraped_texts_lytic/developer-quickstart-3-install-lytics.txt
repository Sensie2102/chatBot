1. Install the Lytics Tag
Installing the Tag
In the Web SDK, Lytics provides a tag that can be placed on your site to collect behavioral data and surface the materialized profile back to your browser in real time. Manual installation instructions are available from within the app at
Data Pipeline
>
SDK
>
Web SDK
.
If your site is a
Drupal
or
Wordpress
site, or you use
Google Tag Manager
we recommend using one of these turnkey methods to install the Lytics Tag:
Drupal
For Drupal users, getting up and running is as simple as installing the official
. Once you have the module added to your site using
composer
or another preferred method, you will want to complete the following configuration steps:
Visit the
Configuration
page either from the module details in the
Extend
section of Drupal or directly from the
Configuration
section (
/en/admin/config/system/lytics
).
Add a valid API Token for your Lytics account. Be sure to give that token
admin
privileges, as that will unlock account verification and direct access to all Lytics systems responsible for surfacing and managing profiles and personalization. This token should also have no expiration, as it will need continued access to your Lytics account. For more information visit our
.
With your token entered. Ensure the
Enable Tab
setting is selected. This will automatically place the Lytics JavaScript SDK onto all public pages of your site.
Upon
saving configuration
, your account details will be surfaced. Be sure to verify that your token is for the Lytics account you are currently configuring.
That's it!
WordPress
A formal WordPress plugin is currently under development and coming soon.
Google Tag Manager
From the left-hand navigation to select
Data Pipeline
>
SDK
>
Web SDK
.
Google Tag Manager.
Create a new
tag and place the Lytics JavaScript snippet into the text box.
Ensure the tag is triggered on the pages you desire. We recommend using the
All Pages
default trigger to start.
Submit and
your Google Tag Manager version.
Testing the Lytics Tag Installation
Once the tag has been installed, validate a successful installation via one of the three following methods:
Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension
(Recommended)
The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above:
Open the extension and ensure it has been activated.
The interface will display a message to confirm the correct installation of the Lytics tag and relevant configuration details.
In-app Verification Assistant
We've built a simple tool to validate that data flows into your Lytics account. Please note that the collected events may take a few minutes to reflect in the UI.
Select
Vault
using the product switcher at the top left.
Use the left-hand navigation to select
Setup
>
JavaScript Tag
At the bottom of the page
Setup click the
refresh
button to validate installation if it does not already state
Successfully installed
.
Manually
If you prefer to verify the installation manually, you can do so by opening the Chrome developer console and ensuring
jstag
is accessible. In addition, by viewing the network tab, you can monitor data collection requests being sent to
lytics.io/c
and personalization requests being loaded from
lytics.io/api/personalize
Testing the Current Visitor's Profile via JavaScript SDK
The final step to verify installation is ensuring you can access your visitor profile. This profile is built and delivered in real-time as you engage with content.
Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension
(Recommended)
The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above:
Open the extension and ensure it has been activated.
Access
Profile
from the bottom menu in the Chrome extension.
This section of the extension profiles two views into your profile.
The first is the
Summary
showcasing available attributes and affinities.
The second is the
Details
, which profiles a raw JSON dump of all available attributes and insights accessible via the Personalization Engine web SDK.
