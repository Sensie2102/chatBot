Use cases
The best match strategy does not apply any special business logic. It suits device-centric business models that do not rely on uniquely identifying users. Four general use cases are suited to the best match strategy.
Brands that do not support login behavior.
Brands that do support login but always assign a primary unique ID to users on first contact.
Brands that provide their apps core features to users without requiring them to create an account.
Brands that require users to create an account before the app can be used at all.
Requests
Since the best match strategy does not support login IDs, there are no
login
or
logout
requests, only
identify
, for identifying a user based on your configured identity priority and the information in the request, and
modify
for altering an identity for a given MPID.

Since the Best Match strategy doesn’t enforce uniqueness of IDs, this profile now has 2 email lookups.

Now that we have the email, it’s higher rank in the Identity Priority means we’re back to profile 1. A new Android ID lookup has been added for profile 1.
